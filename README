Version: R1
Release date: December 6, 2010.

Fixes from last version:
	- fixed defense tower building conditions (if any other towers, visible resources or objects lie in the cell a tower cannot be constructed)
	- fixed tower drain error (it was previosly possible to obtain a Division by Zero error for units lying in the cell in which a tower is being
	  constructed)

Added functionalities:
	- the Client0 class contains a new method called requestState() which returns the player state as stored by the server application.
	  It might be usefull to call this method at the beginning of a round (before any other actions) to find out if your units have suffered
	  from adversary tower drains, or to check the status of your own towers
	  
	- added log4j logging functionality. Both cqclient and cqserver archives now contain a file called logging.properties which sets customizable
	  directives for message logging.

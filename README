Version: R0
Release date: December 17, 2012.

Version: R1
Release date: January 21, 2013.

Changes from version R0

- fixed energy consumption error for Move action. The weight of carried objects and resources is now taken into account.
- fixed upgrade error. Units can no longer upgrade past the maximum level of a blueprint. A NoUpgradeError transition result is returned when such
  an attempt is made. A method to check the maximum upgrade level for each blueprint has been added.
- fixed Gold pickup issue. When a unit picks up Gold it is now added to the player in the `gold' field of the PlayerState.
- updated javadoc folder in the archive
- corrected `deadUnits' count in PlayerState
- server now logs different messages for successful and failed actions
- updated CraftingQuest3 Rulebook


Version R2
Release date: January 27, 2013.

Changes from version R1

- corrected update of unit and tower sight after action execution
- fixed re-spawn behavior: a unit is now correctly re-spawned to its starting position after it has been killed
- fixed score computation on the server side: killing sprees and first blood are now taken into account; server does not count kills for units that
  are already dead


Version R3
Release date: February 8, 2013

Changes from version R2

- fixed incorrect kill action where a player could attack his own units and increase his score
- fixed update of unit position in move action. The BasicUnit view of a cell is now correctly identified by its unitId (instead of the playerId) 
  when changing positions


Version R4
Release date: February 12, 2013

Changes from version R3

- fixed ConcurrentModificationException error in AttackAction when dropping all objects that the killed unit had possessed.
- fixed error where a unit could drop its crafted objects and still have some of them equipped.
- fixed trap removal error. Once a trap is sprung, it is now removed from the game map, as well as from the player's list of traps.
- modified the part of the scoring formula that accounts for set and sprung traps: successfully laying traps can now only increase a 
  player's score and do so by a maximum of 33%.

Version R5

Release date: February 14, 2013

Changes from version R4

- a player unit can spring its own trap but no longer gains points for doing so
- changed Blueprint creation mode. The server now sets the specific values of each object described by the blueprint, after reading them from the
  GamePolicy.xml file. The client receives the actual values set by the server instead of the static bindings to the client side GamePolicy class.
- updated GamePolicy.xml with better values for client-server synchronization

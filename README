Version: R0
Release date: December 17, 2012.

Version: R1
Release date: January 21, 2013.

Changes from version R0

- fixed energy consumption error for Move action. The weight of carried objects and resources is now taken into account.
- fixed upgrade error. Units can no longer upgrade past the maximum level of a blueprint. A NoUpgradeError transition result is returned when such
  an attempt is made. A method to check the maximum upgrade level for each blueprint has been added.
- fixed Gold pickup issue. When a unit picks up Gold it is now added to the player in the `gold' field of the PlayerState.
- updated javadoc folder in the archive
- corrected `deadUnits' count in PlayerState
- server now logs different messages for successful and failed actions
- updated CraftingQuest3 Rulebook


Version R2
Release date: January 27, 2013.

Changes from version R1

- corrected update of unit and tower sight after action execution
- fixed re-spawn behavior: a unit is now correctly re-spawned to its starting position after it has been killed
- fixed score computation on the server side: killing sprees and first blood are now taken into account; server does not count kills for units that
  are already dead


Version R3
Release date: February 8, 2013

Changes from version R2

- fixed incorrect kill action where a player could attack his own units and increase his score
- fixed update of unit position in move action. The BasicUnit view of a cell is now correctly identified by its unitId (instead of the playerId) 
  when changing positions
